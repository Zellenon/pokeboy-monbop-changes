* Types
** DONE Normal
Not a thing. The absence of a type is considered Normal Type. This reflects how the Type Extraction mechanic, as it exists in the universe, works. If a pokemon has their types extracted, they are considered Normal/Normal

*** IN-PROGRESS Type Gift Mockup
*Electric Type*
- Level 0
  Battery: Electric-types store electric charge to power their abilities. Store up to 3 charges, beginning combat at 0 and gaining 1 charge at the beginning of your turn (once per round). Out of combat, you are considered to have 1 charge unless you charge or discharge during a scene.
  Type Weakness: See type weakness chart. Gain +1 charge when hit by an electric-type attack. Lose 1 charge when hit by a ground-type attack.
  Lightning: Electric pokemon can exert control over the high-voltage energy within their body. Contact with this energy causes 1 damage. A melee attack infused with lightning deals +1 damage and becomes electric-typed. You can spend 1 charge to increase damage by a further +1, extend the energy 4m from your body, or extend radius of the attack to 1m. You can spend multiple charges for multiple boosts, but each boost can only be used once. Lightning can only damage 1 enemy at once.
  Overcharge: At max charge, take 1 damage per charge spent when using Lightning (min 1).
  Charge Up: Spend you turn to gain +1 charge.
- Level 1
  HP: +1 to Max
  Battery: Can now store 4 charges.
  Lightning: You can now use the same boost multiple times.
  Conductors: You can channel lightning through Constructs (plants, webs, rocks, etc manifested through moves) that you are touching for free. This is treated as a melee attack. You cannot increase the range, but you can increase the damage and AoE.
  Accelerate: You can spend a charge to increase your movespeed by 50% for a turn
- Level 2
  HP: +2 to Max
  Battery: Can now store 5 charges.
  Static Charge: Gain an additional charge if there are 3 other electric-types within 4m at the start of your turn.
  Lightning: New boost- Lightning inflicts PARALYSIS on a 6 of a d6 (use the damage die if you roll for damage, otherwise just roll to paralyze).
  Conductors: You can channel lightning through metal as if through Constructs. If the metal objects have HP (pokemon, robots) they take half the damage of the attack.
  Accelerate: While accelerated, you can lose accelerate to gain +2 to a single Roll to Dye to dodge. You can now use Accelerate on an ally within 4m.
  Charge Up: Now gives an additional charge (2 total).
- Level 3
  HP: +1 to max
  Lightning: Gain a free boost with each attack.
  Battery: Can now store 6 charges.
  Decelerate: On a successful Do or Die against the target, you can reduce an enemy's movespeed by 50% and give them a -2 to Do attacks for 2 turns.
- Level 4
  HP: +2 to Max
  Battery: Can now store 7 charges.
  Lightning: Range boost now gives 5m, AoE boost gives 1.5m.
  Accelerate: Now has a 2m radius, boosting all within. If used on an ally, affects all within 2m of that ally.

  * Level 2
