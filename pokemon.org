* Types
** DONE Normal
Not a thing. The absence of a type is considered Normal Type. This reflects how the Type Extraction mechanic, as it exists in the universe, works. If a pokemon has their types extracted, they are considered Normal/Normal

** TODO Electric [2/3]
*** DONE Class Mechanic
Builds up Electric Charge and spends it on moves. At high levels, grants passive bonuses with high charge and unlocks new moves / charging methods.
*** IN-PROGRESS Move Theory
Pokemon generate and control electricity.
Stuff to account for:
- Paralyze
- Speed increases
*** DONE 3 Species Gifts
- Joltik absorbs electricity to gain charges and debuffs other electric-types
- Voltorb can spend charges to do a super-explosion that deals half damage to itself with a buffed damage and radius.
- Blitzle passively gains movespeed from having charge
** TODO Psychic [0/3]
*** IN-PROGRESS Class Mechanic
Has "proxy" ability which focuses on increasing the range of mundane actions, such as lifting/punching things from a distance or voodoo-style transference of effects. Focuses on Control and Utility over direct damage.
